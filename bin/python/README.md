# README.md

These are lists of Precinct objects saved into files using the python `pickle` module. To parse them, use `python/load_precincts.py` from the main repository at [hacking-the-election/gerrymandering](https://github.com/hacking-the-election/gerrymandering). These objects contain election and geo data, which originated from the files in the `raw` directory of this repository.
